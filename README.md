# LT1807footprint
This repository is created for the EDA files of the LT1807 operational amplifier SMD IC Chip.
The files vailable are for the 3.9mm width packaging variant of the SMD IC. The Files are created after referring to the uploaded datasheet from Analog Devices
Below are the measurements used (translated to only mm instead of inches) for the footprint. Some measurements were tweaked for tolerance and usage.
